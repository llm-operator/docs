Multi-Cluster Deployment
========================

.. note::

   Work-in-progress.

LLM Operator deploys Kubernetes deployments to provision the LLM
stack. In a typical configuration, all the services are deployed into
a single Kubernetes cluster, but you can also deploy these services on
multiple Kubernetes clusters. For example, you can deploy a control
plane component in a CPU K8s cluster and deploy the rest of the
components in GPU compute clusters.
